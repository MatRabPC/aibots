Matt's Opening Notes
This program will use SimPy, so having pip installed will be very useful.
Check if you have pip: https://dev.to/el_joft/installing-pip-on-windows
Crash course on SimPy: https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/index.html
  ^ps this will take waaay longer than 10 minutes, but it has useful info on how to do interrupts and shared resources
      which sounds super useful.
  ^pps test.py has the code that i typed up from this if you don't want to type everything up
  ^ppps this is the link to the full powa of SimPy: https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topical_guides/index.html

Personally I will be using PyCharm as a text editor so make sure you still have it from last semester I guess
